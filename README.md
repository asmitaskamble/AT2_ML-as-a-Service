* **Title:** **ML as a Service**
* **Introduction:**
The goal of the project is to development of two different machine learning models and the 
deployment of the models to Heroku.
The first task is using a Machine Learning algorithm, predict sales revenue for a given item in a 
specific store at a given time using a model and second task is to forecast the total sales revenue 
for all stores and items for the next seven days by using a time-series analysis algorithm. After 
that, we can analyse which model is going to perform better based on your results
**Data:**
  We have available 4 datsets:
  1. sales_train
  2. item_weekly_sells_prices
  3. calendar_event
  4. calendar

**Models:** 
I performed three models:
1. Linear Regression
2. Random Forest
3. ARIMA
